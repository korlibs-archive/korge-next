/**
 * A boolean open or closed latch for awaiting a single repeating event, like pending
 * recompositions. Closing while already closed or opening while already open is a no-op;
 * only one event producer should be responsible for opening or closing the latch.
 *
 * This implementation is intended for low-contention environments involving
 * low total numbers of threads in a pool on the order of ~number of CPU cores available for UI
 * recomposition work, while avoiding additional allocation where possible.
